# Bioinformatics-IlluminaMGI
_SOPs or documents related to Illumina/MGI sequencing bioinformatics pipeline._

The bioinformatics SOPs written over here assumes that you already have access to Monash MASSIVE account and project.

For the guidelines, I wrote the script based on my MASSIVE account, project, and directory, so please change the codes as per yours.

In terms of directory within the scripts, I will be replacing the project folder directory (e.g., _/fs04/hj18/_) with _~/_ to avoid confusion. You can name your directory based on your preference, it will not cause any issue with running of scripts.
