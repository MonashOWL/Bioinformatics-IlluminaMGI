# Bioinformatics-IlluminaMGI
_SOPs or documents related to Illumina/MGI sequencing bioinformatics pipeline._

The bioinformatics SOPs written over here assumes that you already have access to Monash MASSIVE account and project.

For the guidelines, I wrote the script based on my MASSIVE account, project, and directory, so please change the codes as per yours.

In terms of directory within the scripts, I will be replacing the project folder directory (e.g., _/fs04/hj18/_) with _~/_ to avoid confusion. You can name your directory based on your preference, it will not cause any issue with running of scripts.

You can start off by looking at the following documentations:
1) Setting up WINSCP and PUTTY (_WINSCP and PUTTY setup_22032024.docx_)
2) FIGARO and FASTP setup (_FIGARO and FASTP setup_15032024.docx_)
3) Illumina sequencing pipeline (_Illumina sequence pipeline_03062024.docx_)
4) Leave one out at a time, LOO (_Leave one out at a time (LOO) pipeline_17032024.docx_)
5) Source variability, i.e., assessing source library based on number of included source samples (_Source variability pipeline_30102024.docx_)
